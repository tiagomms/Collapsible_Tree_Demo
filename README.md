# Interactive Data Tree for Startup - Demo

Developed in Nov - Dec 2017, this is a demo of the data tree made for a startup. The data tree worked as an interactive map to add new branches, actions and attachments to each branch.

In this demo, the data is retrieved from JSON files. I added in d3 a fake menu below to add action and attachments icons that are saved in the local storage, along with the selected node and nodes that were collapsed.
